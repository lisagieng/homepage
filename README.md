# homepage

This is the initial creation of my web portfolio. The purpose is to showcase my skills of
web development as I am learning them.

I am hoping to update this layout soon to showcase my new skills... but I am
currently occupied with my job doing machine learning.

ALSO:
I have caught wind that some students are using my repo to cheat on their
assignments for GUI I. Be aware that Dr. Zhou has been notified that my code
is being circulated and she will be keeping an eye out for plagiarism from it.
