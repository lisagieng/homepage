HW6 - Multiplication Table in JS with User Input

INSTRUCTIONS
Input 4 integer values into the form. The starting values must be less than the
ending values. Hit submit to generate table. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I had a lot of trouble with this assignment. I began by creating a multiplication
table in js without user input to see the structure. Then I attempted to add headers.
This broke the entire thing. Ultimately I ended up writing how the structure
should look if I added headers, and without any loops. This then gave me an overall
idea of the structure of the table with headers. I then used getElementById to
retrieve the values from the user.

The user will input 4 values: a multiplier start, a multiplier end, a multiplicand 
start, and a multiplicand end. The table will then use JavaScript to generate a 
multiplication table based on the inputted values. 
The form will check for errors from the input; only integers will be accepted.
If invalid inputs are found, an error will message will display under the submit
button, stating what the error is.
